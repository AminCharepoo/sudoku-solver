# sudoku-solver
Input a sudoku problem to find the answer. You have to edit the file to have the sudoku puzzle as a text form. This can get very annoying. 
# puzzle-input
This generates an interface where you can click and input the sudoku puzzle. It will then convert it to a text form for the code to process. This makes copying a puzzle easier.
# ultimateSUDOKUsolver
This is a combination of both files so that after you use the interface it will solve it for you.
